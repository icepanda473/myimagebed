[00:00.00]Yeah, I drew her name with a pencil nib,
[00:02.00]Back in fourth grade, shy like a tangled plug.
[00:05.00]They call me “Nub” ’cause I fix what’s broke—
[00:07.00]ACs hum, projectors stutter to life with a poke.
[00:11.00]Coconut Blue? She’s got summer in her eyes,
[00:13.00]Walks past my desk where the wiring hides.
[00:16.00]I’m no star in math, but circuits I decode,
[00:18.00]Yet my heart’s a loose wire when she strolls down the row.
[00:21.00]We grew up fast, but childhood’s still glued—
[00:24.00]Her laugh’s a spark in this classroom mood.
[00:26.00]She’s textbook grace, I’m duct tape and grit,
[00:29.00]Tracing her shadow where the light switches flip.
[00:32.00]I’ll rewire the world just to catch her gaze,
[00:34.00]Trade all my tools for one unspoken phrase.
[00:37.00]Her name’s my code, my voltage, my spark—
[00:40.00]A pencil-nub kid in love with the dark.
[00:43.00]Eight years old, I carved “CB + PN” in glue,
[00:45.00]Behind the lunchbox rack where the janitor knew.
[00:48.00]She lent me crayons when my pencil snapped,
[00:50.00]Now we’re lockers apart, but the past don’t backtrack.
[00:53.00]She’s honor roll, I’m the outlet they trust,
[00:56.00]Fixing her headphones when they rust or combust.
[00:59.00]Funny how sparks fly when she says “Thanks, Nub”—
[01:02.00]A boy made of solder, heart stuck on a thud.
[01:04.00]I’ve mapped every fuse in this fluorescent maze,
[01:07.00]Ducked under desks where her ponytail sways.
[01:10.00]Maybe she’ll see past the toolbox I clutch—
[01:12.00]A boy scared to short-circuit “like” into “love.”
[01:15.00]We grew up fast, but childhood’s still glued—
[01:17.00]Her laugh’s a spark in this classroom mood.
[01:20.00]She’s textbook grace, I’m duct tape and grit,
[01:23.00]Tracing her shadow where the light switches flip.
[01:25.00]I’ll rewire the world just to catch her gaze,
[01:27.00]Trade all my tools for one unspoken phrase.
[01:31.00]Her name’s my code, my voltage, my spark—
[01:33.00]A pencil-nub kid in love with the dark.
[01:36.00]Maybe someday I’ll swap these pliers for pens,
[01:38.00]Write her a love song in resistor-laden amps.
[01:41.00]’Til then, I’ll stay the boy who makes the lights breathe—
[01:44.00]Fixing her silence, praying she’ll someday see.
